# HTML-projects-only
A collection of mini HTML projects covering almost every tag through practical, real-life examples.
#  HTML Practice Projects – Complete Tag-Based Learning
Welcome to my ""HTML Project Collection"" , where I haven’t just "memorized"  HTML tags — I’ve "understood, applied, and demonstrated" each of them through ""real, topic-based mini projects"".
## Why This Repository?
This repo is a ""learning showcase"" – each project is crafted to include different sets of HTML tags, structured in a way that:
- Reinforces tag understanding with context
- Demonstrates best practices using ""semantic HTML""
- Helps ""anyone revising HTML""  get a quick grasp of various tags via real examples
If you’re learning or revising HTML, this repo is made for you.
##  What You'll Find Inside-:
| Project | Description | Tags Covered |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| ""Media Learning Hub"" | A media-rich hub with audio/video and semantic helper tags. | `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<mark>`, `<kbd>`, `<dfn>`, `<samp>`, `<code>`, `<details>` |
| ""Tech Thoughts Blog"" | A blog layout using semantic HTML, quotes, notes, and keyboard hints. | `<article>`, `<abbr>`, `<time>`, `<blockquote>`, `<kbd>`, `<dfn>`, `<samp>` |
| ""Timeline & Map Explorer"" | A visual project with image maps, figures, canvas, SVG, and fallback content. | `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<map>`, `<area>`, `<iframe>`, `<canvas>`, `<svg>`, `<template>`, `<noscript>` |
##  Learning Approach-:
Instead of just reading syntax, I followed this pattern:
1. ""Studied every tag’s purpose"" from MDN and real-world examples  
   ""Used it in a meaningful way"" inside a small project  
3. ""Grouped tags together by theme"" like forms, media, layout, etc.
This not only helped me learn faster but also gave me confidence to use tags practically in real projects.
##  Tag Coverage
These projects together cover ""almost all"" important HTML tags including:
- Text content tags (`<p>`, `<h1>–<h6>`, `<blockquote>`, `<abbr>`, etc.)
- Media tags (`<audio>`, `<video>`, `<iframe>`, `<img>`)
- Interactive elements (`<form>`, `<details>`, `<progress>`, `<map>`, `<canvas>`)
- Semantic layout tags (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`)
- Metadata (`<time>`, `<dfn>`, `<samp>`, `<kbd>`, etc.)
